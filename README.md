# Migraines are correlated with higher levels of nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide reducing oral microbes in the American Gut Project cohort *(mSystems00105-16)*

Nitrates, such as cardiac therapeutics and food additives, are common headache triggers, with nitric oxide playing an important role. Facultative anaerobic bacteria in the oral cavity may contribute migraine-triggering levels of nitric oxide through the salivary nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide pathway. Using high-throughput sequencing technologies we detected an observable and significantly higher abundance of nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide reductases in migraineurs vs. non-migraineurs in samples collected from the oral cavity, and a slight but significant difference in fecal samples.
